basic relay system between processing & arudino, pairing clients in couplets.

Basic example pairs arduino clients into sender/receiver groups, one sending analogIn values and the other receiving and writing them out with analogOut.

A quick (potentially flawed) implementation to demonstrate analog -> digital -> analog via blowing onto a piezo disk on one arduino and activating a DC motor (as fan) at roughly the same "windspeed".
